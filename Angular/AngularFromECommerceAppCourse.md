# Angular in the ECommerce app development course

These are just some miscellaneous notes on Angular while using it to develop a POC ECommerce app.

**POC: Proof of concept**.

> Angular, in its official website, defines itself as a development platform built on Typescript. 

As a platform, Angular includes:
- A component-based framework to build scalable web applications
- A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
- A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code
