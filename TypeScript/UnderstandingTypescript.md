# Understanding TypeScript

TypeScript is a JavaScript superset, basically a programming language building up on JavaScript. **TypeScript can't be executed by JavaScript environments like the browser or Node.js**.

TypeScript is a programming language, but we must think of it as whole tool, including the compiler that compiles our TypeScript code into JavaScript. We write TypeScript code, with all the new features and all the advantages, then we compile it into regular JavaScript code.

**But how can TypeScript add new features if what we get in the end is regular JavaScript?**

The TypeScript compiler compiles these new features into JavaScript workarounds, we use the "new" and nicer way of doing things in TypeScript and then our code gets compiled into complex JavaScript snippets that we would have to write ourselves otherwise.

As the name implies, TypeScript incorporates types, which is a much safer way to develop our applications and allows us to identify errors before the error occurs at runtime in the browser or the runtime environment, and fix them at development stage.
